# GLauncher project.
## GLauncher: "README.md" file.

This project was moved over from SourceForge, in it's current state it is only the webpage content that would load inside a "Game Launcher" program.

Project requires much work, what currently exists is fairly dated now.

## Instructions
Edit the files inside "upload" as desired and upload it to a webserver, a good location is on a subdomain, for example "http://launcher.yourwebsite.com"

The launcher loads this page, so once the launcher is deployed you can change the contents at will by editing the webpage files.

## Requirements

To host the launcher page you will need a webserver, we recommend  Apache or Nginx for this. (http://www.apache.org/ http://nginx.org/)
